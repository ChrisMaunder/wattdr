WattDr is a free utility for comparing bike power meters. It can connect to multiple power meters with bluetooth. Any power meter that follows the official specification should work. It has been tested ith Stages left-sided power meter, PowerTap P1S single sided pedal and Cycleops Magnus smart trainer.

The code for reading power meter will be open sourced so that others can use it and improve it.

If you find a bug, please file a new issue. Thank you.
